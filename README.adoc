= POMS Selector for Directus

This is currently being tried as a part of a POC in our new CMS selection traject.

https://jira.vpro.nl/browse/SYS-1179

Adds a new field type 'pom selector'. This can be used to have a text-field with a button next to it 'select in poms'. This will pop up the https://poms.omroep.nl/CMSSelector/example[poms CMS selector], which allows for selecting an item from poms. The MID will be filled in the text field.

== Installation

It is made available as an https://www.npmjs.com/package/directus-extension-poms-selector[NPM package].

The field type interface will appear. And can be configured with several options of the Poms Selector itself.

It it e.g. deployed in docker like this:

.package.json
[source, json]
----
{
  "dependencies": {
    "directus-extension-poms-selector": "^0.2.0"
  }
}

----

.Dockerfile
[source, docker]
----
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /builder
COPY package.json package-lock.json /builder
RUN npm install  

FROM directus/directus:10

ENV NODE_ENV test
ENV KEY directus-poc
ENV SECRET secret
ENV DB_CLIENT 'sqlite3'
ENV DB_FILENAME '/data/database'
ENV EXTENSIONS_PATH '/directus/extensions'
ENV STORAGE_LOCAL_ROOT '/data/uploads'

ENV CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_DIRECTIVES__SCRIPT_SRC="'self' 'unsafe-eval' https://poms-acc.omroep.nl https://poms.omroep.nl"

EXPOSE 8055
VOLUME "/data"

COPY start.sh /directus/start.sh

USER root

RUN  rmdir /directus/database /directus/uploads && \
     chmod +x /directus/start.sh

COPY --from=builder /builder/node_modules/directus-extension-poms-selector/dist ${EXTENSIONS_PATH}/interfaces/poms-selector
 

# set to numeric id of user node
USER 1000

ENTRYPOINT ["/directus/start.sh"]
----

So, the extension is copied into the extension directory. Furthermore, it is important to allow the needed javascript from the poms domain to be loaded, via the security policy setting.


== TODO

* the poms url is still hard-wired to poms-acc, this needs to be configurable (I didn't figure out yet how to do that yet)
